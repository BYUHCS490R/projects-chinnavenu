        <P>A complete web address that points to an outside website.</P>
        <p>What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</p>
        <p>The root is the starting point of a file system, and folders and file names create the path that shows where a file is located within that structure.</p>
        <p>What is a default document?</p>
        <p>A default document is the file that a web server automatically serves when a user requests a directory on a website without specifying a particular file name. Common default documents include index.html or default.html.</p>
        <p>What is the difference between a relative link and an absolute link?</p>
        <p>A relative link points to a file or resource within the same website or directory structure
            , while an absolute link points to a file or resource on a different website or domain.</p>
