        <h1>Intrests</h1>
        <P>I enjoy spending my time playing table tennis because it keeps me active, sharp, and competitive while also being a fun way to connect with friends. I also love exploring new places, as it gives me the chance to experience different environments, cultures, and perspectives. Whether it’s the excitement of a fast-paced game or the adventure of discovering somewhere new, both interests bring energy and balance to my life.</P>

        <H1>About links</H1>
        <P>A <mark>relative link</mark> is a type of hyperlink used in web design that points to a file or page by describing its path in relation to the current page’s location, instead of using the full web address. For example, if a webpage and an image are stored in the same folder, the image can be linked with just its file name rather than the entire URL. Relative links make it easier to move entire websites or folders without breaking the connections between pages, since the links adjust based on their relative positions within the file structure.</P>

        <P>An <mark>absolute link</mark> is a type of hyperlink that provides the complete web address (URL) to a specific resource, such as a webpage, image, or document. It includes all necessary components like the protocol (http or https), domain name, and the full path to the resource. For example, an absolute link to a webpage might look like this: "https://www.example.com/page.html". Absolute links are useful when you want to ensure that a link will always point to the same location, regardless of where it is used or accessed from.</P>
